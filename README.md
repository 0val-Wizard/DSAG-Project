# DSAG-Project – Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment
Data Structures and Algorithms(DSAG) introduced recursion and data structures which were helpful in solving problems using a programming language. Topics covered include stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. Searching techniques and sorting algorithms will also be covered.

### Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAG) module assignment.
The project involves completing coding tasks, applying fundamental data structure and algorithm concepts, and demonstrating practical implementation using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

DSAG Project required us to answer questions designed to showcase our understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Questions Breakdown
##### Question 1 – Python Quick Start (5 marks)

- Completed the LinkedIn Learning – Python Quick Start course.

- Obtained and uploaded the certificate to LinkedIn.

- Added screenshots of the certificate and LinkedIn profile to the notebook.

Skills covered: Basic Python setup, syntax, and comparisons with Java.

##### Question 2 – Drawing a Chinese Character (10 marks)

- Used Python’s turtle graphics module to draw a Chinese character.

- Structured the solution into functions for clarity.

- Implemented loops and turtle commands to build strokes.

- Avoided write() (as instructed).

- Final output: Autonomous drawing of the character corresponding to register number.

Key learning: Breaking a complex figure into reusable drawing functions.

##### Question 3 – Sequence Generation (5 marks)

- Implemented code to generate the sequence:
1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, … (factorial progression).

- Used loops and soft-coded input (user can choose number of terms).

- Displayed sequence in a clear format with term indices.

Example:

term = int(input("How many terms? "))
sequence = [1]
for n in range(1, term + 1):
    sequence.append(sequence[-1] * n)


Key learning: Efficient iterative computation of factorial-based series.

##### Question 4 – Palindrome Checker (10 marks)

Built a function to check:

Traditional palindrome (ignoring spaces, punctuation, capitalization).

Word-unit palindrome (sentence reads the same word-by-word).

Used string cleaning, normalization, and filtering (isalnum).

Provided comments for clarity and readability.

Demonstrated results for multiple test cases.

Key learning: Advanced string manipulation and algorithm design for text problems.

##### Question 5 – Quiz Generator (18 marks)

- Developed a quiz program using only Python’s random module.

- Loaded quiz data (MCQs and True/False) from a provided text file.

- Features:

    - Specify number of questions.

    - Option to randomize questions and answer order.

    - Show correct answers when user is wrong.

    - Present final score and option to retake quiz.

    - Designed to work with any unseen text file of quiz questions.

    Key learning: File handling, randomness, and interactive program design.




**Testing & Outputs**

- All implemented code blocks include sample runs and expected outputs.
- Screenshots and inline results in the notebook demonstrate correctness.

**Key Learnings**

- Reinforced understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- Gained practice in optimizing solutions.
- Strengthened ability to write clean, documented Python code.
